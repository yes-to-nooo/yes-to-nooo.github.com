#### Manifesto for Yes! to Not Only Object-Oriented Development

I'm an enthusiastic signer of [NOOO](http://notonlyoo.org/) as `01010001` Giacomo Stelluti Scala. My purpose is to **learn and share** knowledge about **Functional Programming**, keeping in mind this principles:

> Functional programming is a state of mind. It is a way of thinking differently about the problem. <sub>(1)</sub>

> It's a common misconception that the functional and OO programming methodologies compete; in fact, they're largely orthogonal. <sub>(2)</sub>

#### From Theory to Practice

In practice YES!-to-NOOO will enumerate blog posts, books, code samples and OSS putting them in relation with NOOO manifesto points.

If you're interested and want to join this sharing of knowledge please contact me via Twitter: [@gsscoder](https://twitter.com/gsscoder).
